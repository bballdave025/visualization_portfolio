# higgs_boson

## Presentation (Preview) README

The goal with this project/visualization was twofold.

1. Use real data from CMS (one of the experiments involved in the discovery of the Higgs Boson) to recreate the discovery. For the discovery, particles which participated early on in the collision (_parent particles_) were reconstructed from particles into which they decayed (_daughter particles_). By looking at the mass and velocity of the daughter particles and using an invariant mass formula from relativity, we can find the invariant mass of the parent particle. This invariant mass includes its total mass-energy (remember, $E = m c^2$). This can be thought of as the mass of the parent particle along with the energy coming from its velocity. Because of the way we take the measurements (in what we call the center-of-mass frame), the values of the invariant mass will most-frequently  This included getting and understanding data about the physics processes we understand including particles with masses close to the

Excellent explanation! Comment on "the term 'zero momentum frame'" (ZMF). We can have a ZMF that's not the CofM frame (CofMF). To be the CofMF, we need: 1.sum of the particles' 3-momenta to be **0** _&_ 2. origin of the frame to be at the particles' center of mass. Consider 2 pions, 2 units of space apart, heading directly away from each other, each with a speed of 1. Ex. ZMF, not CofMF: **r1** = (3,-1,0), **r2** = (3,1,0), **v1** = (0,-1,0), **v2** = (0,1,0) `=>` sum(**p**)= **0**, **r_cofm** = (3,0,0) != (0,0,0). For CofMF, redefine coords such that all is the same except r1_x=r2_x=0

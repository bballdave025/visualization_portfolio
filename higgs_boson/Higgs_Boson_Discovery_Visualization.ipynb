I did participate in _some_ collaboration with LHC groups. I was even invited to the [4<super>th</super> of July Discovery Announcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson#Search_before_4_July_2012) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230314192829/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson)), but I got my keys locked in my car while hanging out with friends halfway to Columbia University.

The Higgs boson can decay into lighter particles and energy as long as its daughter decay particles and the energy is equal to the original mass-energy of the Higgs.

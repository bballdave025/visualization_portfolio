    "A nice visualization to take me back to grad school - where I worked at [BNL](https://www.bnl.gov) / [RHIC](https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/) / [PHENIX](https://www.phenix.bnl.gov/) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230314100142/https://www.bnl.gov/world/) / [archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230312202521/https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/) / [archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230314191656/https://www.phenix.bnl.gov/)) which basically means I worked at a government particle accelerator. I wasn't at [CERN](https://home.cern/) / [LHC]() / [CMS](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230314192144/https://home.cern/) / [archived]() / [archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230314192110/https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms)), which is one of the experiments contributing to the discovery of the Higgs boson and the provider of the data I'll be using. I did participate in _some_ collaboration with LHC groups. I was even invited to the [4<super>th</super> of July Discovery Announcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson#Search_before_4_July_2012) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230314192829/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson)), but I got my keys locked in my car while hanging out with friends halfway to Columbia University.

    "Let's talk a little about the physics of the data we'll be looking at. You may know that Uranium can decay into lighter elements, as long as the combined mass-energy of the daughters (lighter elements' atoms, energy) is the same as the combined mass-energy - usually just the original mass - of the original Uranium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same happens for particles. The Higgs boson can decay into lighter particles and energy as long as its daughter decay particles and the energy is equal to the original mass-energy of the Higgs. One way that physics allows this to happen is for the Higgs to decay into four $\\ell$eptons. (I use the script '$\\ell$' to avoid confusion between '1' and 'l'.)\n",

Actually, to be technically correct, the Higgs boson should be off-shell (virtual), too, and we should see it labeled $H^{(*)}$. Just for fun, I'll put in this image from the [Wikipedia article on the Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson#Discovery_of_candidate_boson_at_CERN) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230314192829/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson)).

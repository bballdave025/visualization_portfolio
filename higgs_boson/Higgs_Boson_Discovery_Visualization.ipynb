I did participate in _some_ collaboration with LHC groups.

Let's just say it lets us get away with writing equations and measurements without including the defining constants, which include $c$. If you want to know more, you can also look up [nondimensionalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondimensionalization) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230316040337/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondimensionalization))); I'm guessing you probably _don't_ want to know more, or even as much as I've said.<br/>\n",

    "That shows our electron invariant mass to be -8.520275 (GeV). I can live with the invariant mass being negative. I think that means it's an antiparticle (positron, a.k.a. anti-electron, in this case). However, our invariant mass should, in that case, be -0.0005. (The invariant masses of the Z-bosons and the Higgs show up in GeV - natural units again - so I would expect that of the electron to do the same. I don't know how the invariant masses of the Z-bosons would be close to correct, but those of the electrons wouldn't be correct. The electrons are observed, so they shouldn't be off-mass-shell at all. I think I'll at least try with the other three particles. If they all seem weird, it will be off to Physics StackExchange."

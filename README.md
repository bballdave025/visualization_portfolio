# visualization_portfolio
A place to put some of my favorite visualizations, whether completely-guided from tutorials or completely-original, or anywhere in between.

## First Visualization - Higgs Boson

The first one I'll do here is from my academic background - MS Physics at the University of California at Riverside with research at the **R**eletavistic **H**eavy **I**on **C**ollider - [RHIC](https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230303001906/https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/)), specifically at a **P**ioneering **H**igh **E**nergy **N**uclear **I**nteraction e**X**periment - [PHENIX](https://www.phenix.bnl.gov/) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230305034745/https://www.phenix.bnl.gov/)). I was able to be part of the research and discussion - much more discussion than research - concerning the discovery of the Higgs Boson, which happened at [CERN](https://www.home.cern/)'s ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230305014745/https://www.home.cern/)) LHC - in France and Switzerland.

I'm following a [guide](https://opendata-education.github.io/en_Workshops/exercises/discussion.html) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230305034951/https://opendata-education.github.io/en_Workshops/exercises/discussion.html)) from the [Helsinki Institute of Physics](https://www.hip.fi/) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230305040722/https://www.hip.fi/)). The data comes from the **C**ompact **M**uon **S**olenoid - [CMS](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230305041155/https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms)) - experiment, which lives way under the ground of France on the **L**arge **H**adron **C**ollider - [https://www.hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/](https://www.hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230216163611/https://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/)), oops, the official link is for the [LHC](https://www.home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230305041346/https://www.home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider)), though I believe that the code from the former site is legit. Check it out.

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
if (!(typeof worldHasEnded == "undefined")) {
document.write("YUP.");
} else {
document.write("NOPE.");
}
</script>
```

Anyway, I'll use the data from CMS to visualize something analagous to discovery of the Higgs through the 4-lepton channel. Look at the pictures - they'll be cool. I can also cross-reference the [ATLAS experiment](https://github.com/atlas-outreach-data-tools/notebooks-collection-opendata) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230305041631/https://github.com/atlas-outreach-data-tools/notebooks-collection-opendata)).

I'll also probably to a mass spectrum from PHENIX to relive the good ol' days. [Their github](https://github.com/PhenixCollaboration) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230305041735/https://github.com/PhenixCollaboration)) will likely be useful.

## Second Visualization - Beginning Linux for the Particle Physicist

This is a step-by-step tutorial/guide that I wrote for my friends in graduate school. Many of them had only used physics-specific languages and software that often existed on Windows. I consolidated my notes (back around 2010) and gave them out to help people. 

I want to write an even-more-accessible version, and I'm going to use Jupyter's C++ thingy (technical term), [xcpp with jupyter-xeus and xeus-cling](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling/stable) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230305032801/https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling/stable)). You can start a new notebook by going to [https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling/stable](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling/stable). It will give you your own workspace, which you can realize by looking at the hex identifier in the URL. Mine is [https://hub.ovh2.mybinder.org/user/jupyter-xeus-xeus-cling-8797mir1/lab](https://hub.ovh2.mybinder.org/user/jupyter-xeus-xeus-cling-8797mir1/lab). I'll be going with C++11 (since that's the version I used when writing the tutorial) and then putting the notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230220182022/https://mybinder.org/)). I'm trying it both online, with the links just stated, and locally, using a tutorial [here](https://www.pranav.ai/cplusplus-for-jupyter) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230204120234/https://www.pranav.ai/cplusplus-for-jupyter)). I will also share [another good source](https://blog.jupyter.org/interactive-workflows-for-c-with-jupyter-fe9b54227d92) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230305042400/https://blog.jupyter.org/interactive-workflows-for-c-with-jupyter-fe9b54227d92?gi=01f9d9ebb837)).

## Further Visualizations

These will come from other tutorials I do and from my own mind. I'm looking forward to a project that takes a data-driven approach to show that English is a Germanic language with lots of French vocabulary. In conjunction with that, I also want to look at the Enigma cypher, the encoded text (which I think should _not_ follow the patterns of a natural human language like English, German, or French) including some that has been digitized and archived. My plan is to look at simulating the bombe-based approached used by the Poles, British, and Americans related to Bletchley Park. After that, I'll look at modern, Machine Learning based solutions and see what comparisons I can draw.

There is also forthcoming a family history project that's also a bit of a surveying project. There is a little stream, or creek, that my ancestor used on his farm, in other words, the stream flow through his farm when he first came to the bountiful Utah area, which is not far from the Salt Lake City area. Through an app, I think it's called solo locator, or something like that, I have been able to take pictures with GPS coordinates, compass, orientation, altitude, etc. Etc. I will be using ArcGIS to map out this stream as it flows in the current day. I would also like to get some kind of position versus altitude map, basically a functional representation of the height of the mountain, or really, numerical mesh that's very close to being such a function. If I can't find one, I will use Google maps as I used to use it to plan my bike routes. I will take slices going due east and see how far apart the pixels are. Then I will make other slices also going to East but at the same distance as the you know if x is going east and let's say why is going well. This is not going to do a very good right hand rule but let's just say right is negative. Y that'll do the right handful for height. Then I want the Y pixels put on quote to be the same size as the x pixels, which will make it pretty easy to do a numerical approximation of gradient descent- in the 3D calculus sense rather than the machine learning sense. Then, I want to look at aerial photographs from as far in the past as I can find, or other surveying data, to see where the stream used to flow. I am pretty sure that there have been a lot of changes to the direction that the stream float in since my ancestor used it for his farm. I am hoping that enough information is left after all the houses and roads and other changes to the altitude or the layout of the land. That I can reconstruct where the stream used to flow by finding near to the stream from from to the very top the locally steepest part. So it's standing at any point. Look at the locally steepest part. Go down that part for however long the pixel is or square to two times to pixel is and then look for the steepest part. There is basically what we're happening. That's what water does. Naturally, it's solves these wonderful partial differential equations constrained by a surface and that's what I'm going to try and find to find. You know where the stream would naturally flow. Hopefully the pixels will be saw enough. We will see. And I will come and rewrite this in a way other than dictating it to my speech to text.

Here is (will be) a list of other guided visualizations and datasets I'd like to visualize. Some might go in another repo, but here's a good place to keep track of them.

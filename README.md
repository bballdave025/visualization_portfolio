# visualization_portfolio
A place to put some of my favorite visualizations, whether completely-guided from tutorials or completely-original, or anywhere in between.

## First Visualization - Higgs Boson

The first one I'll do here is from my academic background - MS Physics at the University of California at Riverside with research at the **R**eletavistic **H**eavy **I**on **Collider** - [RHIC](https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230303001906/https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/)), specifically at a **P**ioneering **H**igh **E**nergy **N**uclear **I**on e**X**periment - [PHENIX](https://www.phenix.bnl.gov/) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230305034745/https://www.phenix.bnl.gov/)). I was able to be part of the research and discussion concerning the discovery of the Higgs Boson, which happened at CERN - in France and Switzerland.

I'm following a [guide](https://opendata-education.github.io/en_Workshops/exercises/discussion.html) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230305034951/https://opendata-education.github.io/en_Workshops/exercises/discussion.html)) from the [Helsinki Institute of Physics]() ([archived]()). The data comes from the **C**ompact **M**uon **Solenoid** - []() ([archived]()) - experiment, which lives on the **L**arge **H**adron **C**ollider - [https://www.hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/](https://www.hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230216163611/https://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/)), oops, the official link is for the [LHC]() ([archived]()), though I believe that the code from the former site is legit. Check it out.

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
if (!(typeof worldHasEnded == "undefined")) {
document.write("YUP.");
} else {
document.write("NOPE.");
}
</script>
```

Anyway, I'll use the data from CMS to visualize something analagous to discovery of the Higgs through the 4-lepton channel. Look at the pictures - they'll be cool.

I'll also probably to a mass spectrum from PHENIX to relive the good ol' days.

## Second Visualization - Beginning Linux for the Particle Physicist

This is a step-by-step tutorial/guide that I wrote for my friends in graduate school. Many of them had only used physics-specific languages and software that often existed on Windows. I consolidated my notes (back around 2010) and gave them out to help people. 

I want to write an even-more-accessible version, and I'm going to use Jupyter's C++ thingy (technical term), [xcpp with jupyter-xeus and xeus-cling](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling/stable) (archived(https://web.archive.org/web/20230305032801/https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling/stable)). It _does_ seem that [https://hub.ovh2.mybinder.org/user/jupyter-xeus-xeus-cling-nfmehaj8/lab/workspaces/auto-N](https://hub.ovh2.mybinder.org/user/jupyter-xeus-xeus-cling-nfmehaj8/lab/workspaces/auto-N) is a better link to start from, though that can be reached from [https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling/stable](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling/stable). I'll be going with C++11 (since that's the version I used when writing the tutorial) and then putting the notebook on [MyBinder](). I'm trying it both online, with the links just stated, and locally, using a tutorial [here](https://www.pranav.ai/cplusplus-for-jupyter) ([archived]()). I will also share [another good source](https://blog.jupyter.org/interactive-workflows-for-c-with-jupyter-fe9b54227d92) ([archived]())

## Further Visualizations

These will come from other tutorials I do and from my own mind. I'm looking forward to a project that takes a data-driven approach to show that English is a Germanic language with lots of French vocabulary. In conjunction with that, I also want to look at the Enigma cypher, the encoded text (which I think should _not_ follow the patterns of a natural human language like English, German, or French) including some that has been digitized and archived. My plan is to look at simulating the bombe-based approached used by the Poles, British, and Americans related to Bletchley Park. After that, I'll look at modern, Machine Learning based solutions and see what comparisons I can draw.

# visualization_portfolio
A place to put some of my favorite visualizations, whether completely-guided from tutorials or completely-original, or anywhere in between.

## News! I'm basically only going to have links now.

I'm going to leave the folders as they are. However, each directory will simply house a README.md file with a short description of the visualization, some images with screencaps, and a link to the main repo. Each visualization is going to have its own repo now, see? Here, I'll be making a list of the visualizations with links to the presentation README I described above and to the actual repo with the full visualization.


## Higgs Boson Discovery Visualization

Using physics data from the actual experiment (CMS), we can show how the discovery was made and even re-create the discovery plot! I'm also going to do some consistency evaluation, looking at the invariant mass of each electron resulting from a collision.

[Main Jupyter Notebook with the Analysis and Visualization](https://github.com/bballdave025/higgs_boson_visualized/blob/main/Higgs_Boson_Discovery_Visualization.ipynb), here as a display version on GitHub.

The next link is a very-possibly-still-not-working [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/) notebook. The MyBinder project allows you to run Jupyter Notebooks online without a command-line server. Basically, you're supposed to be able to go to the link, and the web page will have all the text and code input. You can then run the code, play with it, edit it, etc. It's a great project; I just need to learn better how to get it working.

You can go to the [Main Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/bballdave025/higgs_boson_visualized/blob/main/Higgs_Boson_Discovery_Visualization.ipynb) and follow the instructions in **Appendix E** to set up the MyBinder yourself. Hopefully, though, I'll figure out how to get these links working.


## Job Hunt Word Frequency

Some NLP demos and a histogram visualization that can help me to tailor my résumé to job applications. I'll need to get some of the images here!

## Discrete Fourier Transforms - Find Out How Your Equalizer Display Does Its Thing

Discrete Fourier Transforms are very important in Automated Speech Recognition, other NLP applications, and _many_ other fields. This is a presentation I put together for co-workers and friends to help them with the basics. We see how to go from your normal version of a sound wave (pressure vs. time, i.e. time domain) to a spectrum version of a sound wave (energy vs. frequency, i.e. energy domain). This creates peaks and valleys that can be at high or low pitches; that's exactly what you see on your equalizer. We look at artificial waves, then we look at a concert A as played by me on my piano and by my wife on her accordian.

[A PDF Version of the Introductory DFT Information]

[A PNG of Another Application - Seeing if We Have Random Noise or Some Structure]

I now have notebooks using the Wolfram Language - the same one behind Mathematica and Wolfram|Alpha. I highly suggest those tools by the way. For now, I can only show PDFs and PNGs of the unevaluated and evaluated notebooks. At some point, I would like to do the same demonstration using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, or perhaps with some other language.
